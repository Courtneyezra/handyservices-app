Not quite sure what the actual problem is, But it doesn't appear that the tenants inside the house are unable to lock it. Okay. No problem. And then in the same house, there is it's a very small job, but there was, some plumbing work done and, and plastering replastering. And, a really small, tiny, not weighty mirror needs to be put back up on the wall, and a toothbrush holder. So, yeah, a couple of, things at that property. Alright. No problem.

The first of all, the probably the main one is, we have some, windows with wooden frames, which are leaking a little bit and I think could do with some sanding down and resealing on the outside, to to prevent leaking through the through the gaps. Yep. Yep. And then and then there's a fence panel to to put a new fence panel to put in. And then just let me check my list. One sec. Alright. Thanks. Hang on one sec. There's a a shower downstairs to to reseal in the corner a bit as well. And then there's a ceiling light that I can't get out. Like a spotlight bulb is changing, but I can't actually extract extract the, the bulb very well. Okay. No problem. Well, to be honest, it sounds everything you've mentioned, we do that sort of stuff all the time. As you can imagine, calling up to Christmas, we are quite busy. The quickest way in order to get you a quote, if possible do you use WhatsApp by any chance? Yep. Yeah. Perfect. So the quickest method, what a lot of people are doing now, if I'm able to send you a WhatsApp message, once you've had the call, all you have to do is literally just show us a, do us a quick video. If you show us the, the lighting issue you've got with the ball, defense panel, all of it and bobs. It it doesn't matter how long the video is. Basically, we can take it off. If we need to ask you any questions, we can. We can get it back and forward. And then, yeah, we can get your quote sorted. Nine times out of 10, we can get your quote sorted from that, and, it just saves saves you having to pay a call out for you for this to come out. Sounds good. Cool. So I guess you'll send me a message and then Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll I'll send you a message once this we've had this conversation. If you can just reply back, one of us will take a look, and then, we'll go from there. Sounds good. The video probably won't be till this evening because I'm I'm working in a minute as well, if that's alright. Yeah. No problem. That's fine. When when's convenient for you? What's your name? Sorry. Greg. Greg Nelson. Greg. And what's your property code, Greg? N G 81 A T. 1 Alpha Papa. Alpha Tango. Perfect. So you give me about, 1015 oh, I'll tell you that. Sorry. Yeah. If you give me about ten, fifteen minutes, we'll get a WhatsApp sent over, and then, we look forward to hearing from you and get you sorted out. Nice one. Thank you. Alright. Speak to you.

I've got, an outdoor garden shed that needs the roof, refelting. Is that something that you could help with? Yes. Definitely some, something we could help with. I'll be honest, we are really busy going up to Christmas. Alright. Okay. What I could possibly do are you looking to get it done this side of Christmas? As soon as possible. Because I've just been into the shed for the first time in, several days, and it it there is ingress of water. So it's kind of urgent because, obviously, it's, and I want to stop any of the damage as well. I mean, it's not flooding and everything, but the the boards are are damp. There's mold growing, and there's some areas where water is dripping as well. So so I I don't know whether Well if you could come over this side of Christmas, whether you could just maybe cover it temporarily and then come back later on to to to to do that. So I don't know what what's your thoughts. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we do try to fit people in the way possible. So what I can possibly do that might be a bit quicker. Do you use WhatsApp by any chance? I do. Yeah. Yeah. So the quickest and easiest option is if if I can send you a message on WhatsApp, if you could just do as a quick video just showing as, the shed so we can get an idea of size and possibly show us the water square ingress from the inside. We'll take a look. And then if if something we can quote for, we'll quote. Well, if not, we'll we can get you a price sent over just for, like, a temporary fix anyway. So in that way, we can get it looked at quicker, and, you you'll know, obviously, price wise, what what what you're dealing with kind of thing. Yeah. No. No. That's fine. Brilliant. Okay. Brilliant then. I'll, I'll send, just the information you need on the Watson right now then. Alright. Perfect. Sorry. Can I just take your mobile number? Yeah. It's, 07931721 Yeah. 210. Perfect.

Just come out and quote if it just doesn't make sense just at the minute. And plus, we are managing to get the quotes back to pick up for yourself anyway. So if you are happy to get the video over, I'm still wanting to get it looked at today. Right. Yeah. I can send you a video if you'd like to say. Just I just wanted a time scale of when you'd be off to actually come and actually do the job. Oh, alright. Well, to be honest, we possibly could just squeeze him in just before Christmas based off the bits you've said. It would be a squeeze. But what I can do, obviously, is get us a video over today.

I'll send it over to this number now then. I'll send you a video over now and you can go from there. Yeah.

Yeah. What I can I'll send you a message on WhatsApp. If you can just get a video to just showing us the bathrooms and just give us a spoken sort of description, we can give you a ballpark figure.

So what I it won't be me that can't that's contacting you. So I manage the business side of the charity. So it will be the residents themselves.

I've can pass it's just passed your your number on, so I can pass it on to Lisa, the resident who wants a key safe putting on. That's wonderful. So if you can just pass them the number, and then basically, we just ask them to send us a little a quick video of what they what they need and the location, and that allows our guys to quote.

    "transcript": "Hello. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is Steve. If I got the right number, do you do you, install TVs on the wall? Yes. We do. We do. Yeah. Excuse me. I've got, I've we just moved to Mansfield recently from Milton Keynes. So I've got I've got two TVs I took down. I've got the kids to take down in the old house. But I'm I'm not gonna be able I've I've I've struggled to fit them on the wall again because I've got MS, mate, multiple sclerosis. So, I've basically got the left hand side of my body is paralyzed. I've only got one hand. Alright. I've got Alright. No problem. So I've got a Sony Bravia TV and what it fitted in my bedroom. I've got all I've got the the bracket still the wall mounting bracket, which was obviously in the old house, is still attached to it. And I've got all the bolts and everything from the old house. I just need the holes drilled in the wall when it mounted. And then and then I've got another bedroom where we've got a 48 inch Sony Bravia. Exactly the same thing, mate. We've got the the wall brackets there and the bolts. It's just I need someone to drill it and helps me, like, obviously fit it on the wall. So I can't lift it anymore. Is it possible to give me a quote for, like, two TVs? Yeah. No problem. In terms do you know what walls they're going on? Do you know if they're solid brick walls or not? Yeah. Well, this is the problem, right, because the one in my bedroom, one of the wall I really want it on, yeah, I believe is a stud wall. And I had Skye out I had Skye out yesterday, and they said that should be obviously, I noticed anyway. There's, like, like, a wooden joist in there somewhere. You said you can go into that, but I don't know, obviously, where that is. Like, the only way I think you could do it, I'm I'm sure you know, is to maybe drill a hole and use an endoscope and see where it is. But if not, I can have it on the other wall, and it'd be solid brick wall. Well, to be honest, you can use an endoscope or you can use a stud finder. Yeah. What sort of bracket are you looking at using? Is it a fixed wall bracket, or is it a telescopic bracket that It's one that you can pull out and swivel, but I won't ever pull out and swivel it. I won't I won't ever use that. I just had that from the old house because in the old house sorry to talk to you, mate. In the old house, the TV was in the front room, and we had a sofa which was tied on to the TV. So, obviously, obviously, when the kids are watching it, they used to pull the TV out and turn it, so it's obviously facing them. But where it's gonna be in my bedroom, it's never gonna be pulled out and turned because it's gonna be directly in front of my bed. Obviously, it'll just be it's it's basically a cantilever bracket, but it it'd be fully pushed in all the time if that makes sense. It never be pulled out. That makes sense. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's fine. Basically, what it is, we can use specialist fixings as long as you do not using any sort of as long as there's basically no leverage on the black bracket, meaning it's not pulled out. We have actually got fixings that you can use on a plasterboard wall, and we wouldn't have to actually find the stud. Okay. So that's possibly the best sort of, route to go for it, obviously, and then you'd get it on your preferred wall. Yeah. The bracket, to be honest, you could use the bracket you've got, but, ideally, we use flat to wall brackets. So there's literally no leverage on the wall whatsoever when we put these sort of fixings off. Yeah. Yeah. That's just for a safety element. So we can get you a quote to supply if if you did want us to supply the bracket as well, we can supply and fit a flat to the wall bracket, and that can actually fit on a plasterboard wall. And then for the other TV, are you saying that's a brick wall that the bracket's going into? I think it's plaster board as well, mate. I reckon it's a stud board as well. Because I don't know. Alright. And but what's on the bracket? Have you got enough? It's a it's a cantilever again, mate. Alright. So in that case, what possibly best, I can literally get you a quote. That's not a problem. Get you a quote that would be for two, flat to the wall brackets. And, obviously, we use the specialist, specialist fixings to get it onto the passable wall. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright then. No problem. Let me let me just take your postcode because, I don't actually deal with the quotes. I'll get it back to you your quote. Do you use Watson by any chance? Yeah. I do. Yeah. Do you work in Mansfield? Do you live in Mansfield? Yeah. We do Mansfield we do Mansfield Derby, and we do Nottingham. That's what I was thinking, mate. It's because I'm disabled. I don't work anymore. I'm retired. So I'm here on the day. I'm just wondering, would would it be easier if, like, one day in a week, you guys swung by and had a look? And then because I definitely wanna have it done. I'd obviously, as long as it's not, like, you know, out of my price range, I definitely wanna get it done. But, I just thought maybe you might wanna come and have a quick look before. It's entirely up to you, really. To be honest, I'll be completely honest with you. This job isn't a job that we'd even come out to quote. That's number one. But two, we actually do charge to come out and quote. We're actually coming up to Christmas. We're so busy. Oh, okay. Type of job, we we know exactly what's needed, obviously. Yeah. You said you've said what you've said, and I can kinda get the gist of what needs to be done. So what I can do, I can get Mike to send you over a quote. You'll get it over to you. I can get it over to you actually tonight, to be honest, because, we're just clocking off doing the last one. Okay. I can get you over a quote, and then, I'll give you a message on WhatsApp. And then if you do need to ask any questions, we can go back and forth, but we can definitely get you booked in if you're happy. Yeah. Perfect. Because if you would like, I can take a I can take a photograph of the room as well so you can see the wall if you want to, if you need that. I don't know if that's relevant or not, if you need it. Not really in this case, but Okay. It. Obviously, if we're on WhatsApp, it is just perfect for you and if, might want might want to have a look. But no problem. What what did you say your name was again? Sorry. It's Steve. Steve. Steve. Perfect. What's your property postcode, Steve? My what? My postcode? Yeah. Property postcode. Yeah. NovemberGolf 21 Yep. 9 Foxtrot Delaware. 9 Foxtrot Delaware. Number 30. Number 32. Alright then, Steve. Yeah. Give, give us about ten fifteen. I'll get Mike to send you over a quote, and then if you're happy, we'll get you all booked in. Brilliant. Do you need do you need my number, or have you got it now? Your number's co op. Don't worry about it. As long as it's is this your WhatsApp number you're calling us? Yeah. It ends 083. Yeah. 2083. Yeah. That's it. Perfect. Frank Frank, what's sorry. What's your name again? Sorry. My name's Courtney. Courtney. Thanks, mate. Appreciate that. Alright. No worries to you. Speak to you soon.

    "transcript": "Hello. Good afternoon. Hello. Can you have a look at a few little jobs for me, please? What sort of little jobs, do you need help with? There's two curtain poles to put up, a light fitting oh oh, and a blind. A light fitting that's in the dining room move into the living room, and a new light fitting put in the, dining room. And there's two existing wall lights in the dining room, and I've got two new ones. So, they're to replace those. Alright then. No problem. Yeah. We can definitely help with that. What we normally do, because we are really busy going up to Christmas and everyone wants it during Christmas. It's it's been really crazy, to be honest. Mhmm. We get a lot of people to send a video in, but do you use WhatsApp by any chance? I don't know to be able to do that, to be honest. You might struggle. No problem. Well, I can I can get you a price over the phone link so I might give you to be honest, for such small jobs, we don't even we don't actually get time to come out with there's about five of us, and we're we're booked up solid? So for to come out with us, it's an absolute it's an absolute nightmare. But I can give you a price over the phone if that helps. So So would there be no chance of getting it done before Christmas? Yeah. We could we could get it done before Christmas. It's just literally coming out to quote. We just Alright. Right. Yeah. Yeah. We just have to cut it to the minimum. Sorry about that. So you said you've got you've got two curtain poles to put up. Yep. A blind. Yeah. One blind. Yep. Yeah. The live the dining room light moving into the living room and a new light fitting putting in the dining room. So one move in and one you've got a brand new install. Yeah. There's two wall lights in the dining room, and I've got two new ones to replace those. Okay. No problem. I'll just get that to move one light to another room, and then we've got you having a brand new one installed into a new one. Yeah. And there's also a bit of a spruce up. Well, yeah, this is a 100 and more things that need to do. And also in the dining room, there was a tile, loose on the roof. So the ceiling I don't want it all stripping off just to the next so, you know, it's all dry now. So I wanted the paper on the ceiling taken off to the next join if you like. Only the one row of paper to be, removed. It it could be either one or two. Okay. No problem. So two rows two. And one wall. I mean, there's not much wall. It's mainly the French doors. So that wall as well would need paper in. Okay. No problem. Is that where the water damage is then? Yeah. It's all I mean, it was ages and ages ago, and it's all completely dry now. Okay. No problem. Have you got a decorator that can come in and have you got some have you got the matching paper to put back on? It's just lining paper that's in there, and I've got the paper for the ceiling. Alright. That's not too bad. Do you want us do you want us to include putting it back on, or have you got someone? Is that alright? No. No. I'd want you to put it on. And do you paint as well? Yeah. We do painting as well. Yeah. So it sort of patch up the paper and then paint. Okay. No problem. So we're gonna install the, lining paper once the old one's taken off? The, the wall, the paper's off there. So it's just like putting the lining paper on and painting. Okay. No problem. And that after installing the lining paper, did you mention one more job? Ceiling. Ceiling. That was it. So you want the pay yeah. It it would be a couple of, what do you call it? Yeah. No. It's a couple of rows. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean. Seating paper is I'm just looking because we've got a load of jobs that we've done before, so I'm looking for the same similar sort of jobs so I can give you a price. And what area is your property in? It's Lime Avenue, Burton Road, D E 11 T U. T U. To be honest, what it is because we do I've got a price now, but we do the the the longer the sorry. When we booked up, the quicker you want it doing, you sometimes have to pay a bit more because we have to move jobs around to get you fitted in. If you're prepared to wait a bit longer, we can knock the price down a bit. But what I've actually got, I've got someone doing a job in Derby, on Tuesday. So what's probably best is, because you've got quite a few things in it. It sounds like we're not gonna get the quote as accurate as what it needs to be. Is it worth me taking your number and I can give you a call tomorrow and see if we can get someone to pop in on Tuesday? Does that sound like a better idea? Yeah. It's, it's if that's possible. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it it's the better way. Obviously, we can quote about what if if we can do it, we will. So I've got your phone number. What's your name? Sorry. Bridget Lynch. Bridget Lynch. One sec, Bridget. And what's your what's the full, address, Bridget? It's 12 Lyme Avenue, D E 11 T U. D E 11 T U T U. Alright. And I've got that anyway, Bridget. So what I'll do, I'll try my best tomorrow if we can. We can. But if not, I'll give you a call anyway and let you know what's going off, and then, we'll go from there. If if obviously, like I said, if we can squeeze you in, it will be it will be it'll make sense. You know what I mean? But if not, I'll give you a call and let you know what sort of price you're looking at anyway. I was gonna say, can you just give me a rough estimate of what sort of price I'd be looking at? I I mean, obviously, I can't hold you to that because you've not seen it or anything, but just to give me some idea. Alright. And so I'm just gonna run through it again. So you've got one curtain pole or two curtain poles that want to go up? Yep. One blind. One second. So you've got two curtain poles that wanna go up, one blind. You've got a light to be relocated from one room to another. Yep. And you've got a new light that wants installing. Yep. And then you've got two new wall lights, the one going up where your old ones was. Yep. And then you've got, ceiling two rows of ceiling paper that you want, removing. Yep. Is that right? Yeah. And then repapering. Same with the wall and painting. Alright. One second. Let's double check if I've got the right thing for this. So it's one second. I'm just getting a price next. I've got about that many jobs this week. It's it's Okay. Crazy. We've got a price range over here. You said your name was Bridget. Let me just I'll save this just in case so we've got it for next time. So Bridget. It was D one. Right? D e one 1TU. Alright. No problem. And your number ends in 675. So we've got, it's quite a big price range. That's why we possibly got booked. The lower end is £480, and the higher end is $6.50. So, obviously, once if we can get who is it? It's Wayne who will be in Derby on Tuesday. If you can get Wayne to pop around, he can just have a look. We won't charge to be honest, we actually do charge to come out and quote, but if we are close to him, we can squeeze it in. We'll actually come out and give you a quote for free. Oh, absolutely. Thank you. Yeah. Because they have they've got a few jobs. I think they've probably got five jobs. It's gonna be in the morning, though, if that's alright with you, if we can get it. Tuesday morning. Yeah. That'd be fine. Yeah. Alright then. Well, what I'll do, I've got your details. If you leave it till tomorrow, I'll definitely call you back, and then, I'll try my hardest if we can, and then we can go from there and see what we can do for you. Oh, that's really kind of you. You've been really helpful. What's your name? Sorry. My name's Courtney. Courtney. Thank you, Courtney. You've been really helpful. No. No. No. I'm glad you called in there. I'll try my best tomorrow, and if I can, we'll get you in. But if not, I'll speak to you anyway. Alright. Absolutely. Thanks for your help, Courtney. Thanks. No worries. I'll get you in. Just a second. Bye bye. Bye. Bye bye. Bye.",

And, I just need to know whether you know, a few things need to be rectified to make it look nice because I'm selling it. I bought it to do up the property and sell it. And, I'm coming up to Derby this weekend, and I was wondering, you know, whether I could ask you to come in and have a look. Yeah. But there's definitely the sole work, you're talking about. That's not a problem. As you can imagine, everyone wants work during the It's quite busy in the minute. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. So to be honest, we actually charge to come out, which we could possibly settle for the weekend if we have to show it. The other option I've got for you is people, a lot of the time, they're happy to do a video on WhatsApp. So basically, do a video. It's free of charge. So tell them exactly what needs to be done. Yeah. We take a look at the video. We asked you any questions, if you need to. Yeah. I'm going up there. I don't think the kitchen, you know, it just has a little gap there. Wondering that I should put in two more units, and it's got, like, a little raised floor that I think needs to be covered with some wood and, may you know, maybe the back door needs to be done. You know, little things like that. But, yeah, do I send it to this number? Well, what I'll do, just to make it easier, I'll send you a a message on WhatsApp now. Yeah. So once you're in the property, if you just do as a video, show us as much send us much information. And, yeah, we'll check and make that when you catch them in. Oh, that'd be great. Yeah. You're very busy. That means it's quite difficult for you to get things in. It's not very much work. It's just finishing off certain things and making it look nice. Yeah. But we are quite busy, but we do try to switch between where possible. So Okay. Yeah, obviously, once you've got to let me know Thank you. Yeah. Where it seems to be. Yeah. But what's your name, ma'am? My name is Kohila, k o h I l a. Sorry. One second. K o a I l a. So k for k kilo, o h I l a. Okay. No problem. What's the proper first step of the year? It's B E 76 B B. It's, Horsley Woodhouse, Church Lane. It's near, I don't know, Ilkeston, Hina, that sort of area. Yeah. No. It's not. My sister actually is not the part. She's asking you. Yes. But what I'll do then, if you will, I'll get you a WhatsApp sent now. Please. You just give us a message, once it is back to you or once you got the video or stuff. Yes. I'll do that. And then we'll just send it over to you. Alright. And what's your name? Sorry. My name is Courtney. Courtney. Alright. Okay. Yep. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Bye bye then. Alright then. Bye. Bye. Bye.

I looked on the net and, according to your website, you're in Alverston. Is that right? We cover Alveston. So, we do do Nottingham. We do Derby, a little bit of Leicester. But, yeah, we do do Derby, so that's not a problem. Okay. Well, I need someone to assemble a hanging wall unit and and actually fix it to the wall. I did get an automated quote from your website, but no one's been back to me. This is, like, two days ago. But Alright. I'm reluctant to to buy it until I get a firm quote for actually the assembly that I'm getting. Fix it and stop. Yeah. Yeah. No problem. We do this, these sorts of jobs all the time. In terms of getting you back a quote, the we are quite busy. Obviously, coming up to Christmas, everyone wants stuff doing. Do you use WhatsApp by any chance? I do, but I'm not a big fan of it. Why? Just basically, the quickest and easiest way I I was thinking, if you could just send us a screenshot of the actual unit that you want putting up so we can see exactly what it is, we can literally give you a quote near enough straight away. So that's probably the most accurate way of getting a quote. I did send I did send a text message yesterday with two images attached to this, number that I'm ringing, the, 7449 number. To be honest, I don't know what it is. We we struggle with text messages. A lot of people have said that. What what I can do, I can send you a WhatsApp message now. If you just literally can reply back to that, we can take a look and that'll be the quickest so we can get you a quote and then you'll straight away. Okay. Send me a WhatsApp then. Alright then. Perfect. Sorry. What's your name? It's Richard. Richard. And you said you're at Alveston? No. I said you were at Alveston. That's what it said on your website. But I'm guessing that you just cover the area. Yeah. We just thought we'd cover obviously. And where where was you? So what's what's your plan there? Little over. Little over. Alright. No problem, Richard. Give me about five minutes. I'll get you, WhatsApp sent, and then we'll take a look and we'll go from there. Okay. Alright. Cheers. Alright. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Bye. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Good afternoon. Hi there. Yeah. I'm hoping that you can help me out with a quote, please, for a rental property that I own that needs a few jobs doing to it. I wonder if that's something that you look into for us. Yeah. That's definitely something we we can do. What sort of jobs, roughly, have you got? It's a bit of a mixture. It's empty at the moment, and we're looking to sell it. But we've had some feedback that it needs tidying up. So it's mainly interior decorating, so whitewashing. Perfect. Pardon? Yeah. No. Sorry. Go on. Sorry. I didn't want to interrupt you. No. No. No. Sorry. Sorry. There might be, like, a replacement bath panel that's needed and some resealing of the bathroom. Things like that, you know, just tidying up to sell. It's probably probably easier if I could show somebody what the work would need to be done at the property. Yeah. That's fine. As you can imagine, coming up to Christmas, we're really, really busy. Yeah. We're struggling to get anyone fitted in. A lot of our customers are just typical residential, so we do ask them to send us in videos in order to show us the job so we don't have to physically go out and inspect. For us to come out and inspect, we can. There's not an issue. We do have a small charge, which is knocked off the final bill of £39. That just covers us to come out, obviously, take a look, and we get back to you with an itemized quote. So if you did go ahead, obviously, that £39 is deducted. But that just covers, obviously, our time and obviously, getting you a quote together and bits and bobs. So we can get you booked in. If you do want me to give you a message on WhatsApp because What time is it now? We're just literally finishing up. Yeah. So I can I can drop you a message on WhatsApp and then get some dates back to you in terms of what's kind of convenient for you? Yeah. And you can book a date if that works. Yeah. When let me, send me a message, and then I can just respond to that, can't I? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's your availability? What's your realistic availability to doing any work? Are we looking in the new year now? It depends on the scope of work. Obviously, you said so it's a full repaint that you're gonna want. It's a majority of it's open. It's a, a two bed terrace house. It's, open planned downstairs. It'd be the dining room and the living room, the majority of it, and then the two bedrooms at least. Okay. Okay. And and other than that, what other works roughly? So I can just get some sort of idea possibly. I think there might be a replacement of a bath panel because that's quite faded, and I think it will help with kind of the look of the bathroom. We're trying to sell it, you see. So we don't wanna do loads to it because somebody's probably gonna come in and come buy it and completely change it anyway. But it is really, really tidy untidy because it's been a rental property for ten years. So it needs Okay. It just needs Spruce off. Tidying off. Yeah. Freshening. Freshening. That's the word. Freshening off. Yeah. So as visitors we can get away with, but equally, we're realistic about getting some stuff done. So that's kind of why I was keen for somebody to actually come and see it in person because you know It might give you a few ideas. Exactly. And, like, what stands out to you might not stand out to me. Does that make sense? Yeah. No. That that makes sense. Yeah. So what I'll do then, because we are finishing, obviously, I'll see what dates we've got available. You can see what dates you've got, and then, yeah, we'll put you in. We'll come out, and we'll possibly give you some ideas, take a look at what needs to be done, and we get you a quote straight away. Okay then. So would it be sort of that sort of work? Would it be in the New Year then? To be honest, we could possibly fit that in. We we do have jobs coming all the time. So, basically, it's the quicker we quicker we get to you and quicker we get your quote and quicker you accept, we have definitely got the chance of fitting you in. But it's just obviously, we'll see obviously your time scale of when we can get there. But, yeah, as of as of this this minute now, we we definitely can get that fitted and that's not a problem. Oh, okay. Cool. Thank you. So, yeah, if you wouldn't mind sending some options, I think it's probably a video call isn't gonna video isn't gonna work for a quote. No. No. Because I kinda need to chat it through with someone, I think. Yeah. No problem. Roughly off the top here, do you know what sort of dates you might have available? I'm, I'm on annual leave this week, and then I'm flexible on kind of work, and I've got flexibility on a Monday and a Friday then or evening. Okay. No problem. What's the postcode? NG11. Yep. I've now gone blank. It's I've got everything. It's Don't worry about that because we we just use the first part of postcode anyway. So NG11. And what's your name? Sorry. Sarah. Sarah. Alright then, Sarah. What I'll do, because it'll probably be re Richard that could possibly pop over. Okay. I'll check what we've got on. I'll see what's, even if you've got anything close to M G 11 so it makes it easy for us. Yeah. Yeah. So I've looked for this week, and then you said a Monday or Friday, possibly next week? Or a Friday. Yeah. I work from home on those days, and we're only, like, five minutes around the corner. So I could literally just nip and meet you if I know a time. I can just nip out of my working day to come and have a chat with someone. Alright then. No problem. Leave that with me, and I'll get you a WhatsApp sent. And then, yeah, we'll go from there, and we'll get a date set. Oh, thanks so much. Thanks for chatting. Alright. So sorry. I've got a terrible it was Sarah. Sarah. Yeah. Sarah. Yeah. Sorry. I didn't write that. Alright then, Sarah. Leave it with me. I'll get a message over. Thanks a lot. Have a good evening. Thanks a lot. You too. Yeah. Bye bye. Bye.",

One of them is we'll take a look, and then we can basically ask any questions if needed and then kind of get you a quote if we can or we'll we'll just see the best sort of step up. Nine times out of 10, we do kinda give quotes just from videos, so it'll make it a lot easier for you. Okay. And if you were able to do it, obviously, like, with this being a busy time, when do you think would be the soonest you might be able to do the work?

The line went a bit bad then. It's Julie calling from where? Sorry. From Heaven Branch Estate and Lettings, a management company. Okay. Hi. How can I help? So we're looking for someone who can fix or repair a shower screen, a sliding shower screen, one of the property wear management. Okay. Okay. No problem. Yeah. What is the pricing and your availability, please? What is the what? Sorry. Price and availability. Yes, please. Well, price wise, to be honest, you'd have to have it you need to take a look. Do you have any images or videos that you'd be able to get over to us by any chance? No. Sorry. Not at this moment. No. Can I take a look at them? Is are you charged for call out fee or is it includes in a job price? So, basically, how it work is we we charge job price. So we charge for the actual job. We give free quotations if you're able to supply us with pictures or videos. Otherwise, if we if we do have to go out to the property, we charge £39. But if the, estimate is accepted, we remove the £39 so the call out is is potentially free if if you choose to, obviously, accept the quote. So we can if you haven't got any images, we can book in to go out and take the lot, and then it will be deducted if that works for you. So it's £39 to come and look. Yep. £39 to go to the property, to get an idea of what worth. But then if you do accept the quote, we do deduct the £39. So You will deduct the extension is free. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What is the pricing roughly? I just didn't inform that it's, like yeah. Sorry. So in terms of prices for the shower screen, we we we wouldn't really know if it's a repair job or it's a brand new installation.

And it's been we've been informed from the tenant. It start to it's unstable now, and it's starting to turn to be honest, I don't know. Right. Well, so beyond as you can appreciate, there's so many different styles of sliding doors, so many different sort of mechanisms. It's hard to give you a price. But if we did go and look, if you can supply us with videos or pictures, obviously, that's the cheaper, quicker option. If not, well, obviously, we can book you to go out, and then, we will deduct the £39 once we've once we've accept with the quote. Right. If you will come just for a look for those £39, and then if we will not accept your quote, we're just paying £39. Correct? Yeah. Yeah. Exactly that. Yeah. Right. Okay. Thank you very much for your information. I will try to maybe get some pictures or video and to send for you. If no, then maybe I will just arrange you to come and see. Yeah. No problem. That's fine. Do you use WhatsApp by any chance? Yes. I do. What is the availability roughly? Is it will be able to be this week or the next week?

It's the Ground 1st Floor. Ground 1st Floor. Yeah. No problem. What what seems to be the issue? So, basically, what it is, one of the gutters, isn't sitting right, and there's a lot of, water that it's holding. And it needs to be angled up, and basically, it's, angled up and screwed back in. So that basically isn't moving because it's really loose at the moment. And, I need I need it straightened up and the sort of water's flowing the opposite way so it could go down in the drainage to the Ground Floor. Alright then. No problem. We do this sort of stuff all the time, to be honest. So it's not a problem. Are you at the property or are you gonna be at the property any point today? I mean, if you went down, I I mean, I'm literally coming from Nottingham. I'm going back to London now. And it's one of my, it's my mom's property. Alright. Not not for such a quote. Because, basically, we're we're that busy going up to Christmas, We actually charge to come out on quote. So the easiest option if possible, if you could just get us a quick video on WhatsApp just showing us obviously the issue we've got and just give us a spoken description, we can take a look and we can get you a quote in there and not straight away. Says you haven't obviously paid for this to come out and quote, and it's just quicker sort of option if possible. Right. Okay. Fair enough. I'll tell you what you can do then. If you WhatsApp me just now just on my number, and I will send you, the video of what the issue is. Because what it was, I was I was down, Nottingham now, and I'm literally on my way back to London. Oh, okay. So, I'll get you that video out. You give me a quotation. If you could do it literally as soon as possible because what's happening is that because of the guttering holding water, the water is actually going into the property, and it's dampening two side of our walls.

    "transcript": "Hello? Hello. Good afternoon. Oh, good afternoon, sir. Just picked up your number from the Internet. Got a house in Alveston that needs some, little bit of handiwork going to the bathroom and potentially, some fencing at the at the back in the back garden. Are you based in Alveston? Yeah. We well, we're based in Derby. There's quite a few of us. We actually do Derby and Nottingham. Okay. Fair enough. So you will take a look at it. What it is. It's me. So we're me and his mum are from London, but I've gotta go back to London tonight. Although I'm I'm a Derby float. But, I was wondering if you might be able to pop around tomorrow, and the the work in the bathroom is minuscule. So so I'm in the toilet seat and a and a shower holder. But this I mean, I don't know if you'd be able to I'm assuming you do fencing and that kind of thing. Yeah? Yeah. We do fencing and stuff. In terms of getting a quote back, to that, we we actually charge the quote. So wherever possible, we can save you money and time. But, yeah, the money the work in the bathroom, we just want someone to come and do it, basically. We'll pay for it. We don't really want a quote for that, to be honest with you. Well, what I could probably do is probably gonna be the best option so we could see all of it. Do you use WhatsApp or your son by any chance? My son will use WhatsApp. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because, basically, a lot of people know that they're a lot more, comfortable with just sending us literally a a short video just showing us all the bits and bobs. We can take a look. We can ask any questions if needed, and then we can file you a quote over literally the same day. Right. I'm going to give you a call now. Would you be able to come over and do any of the remedial work tomorrow or Saturday just in the bathroom? Saturday, I'm sure we've got a slot possibly available. That that was literally just just the cash. I mean, if you do, you know, don't don't really want, to go because it it I think someone like yourself is, you know, well versed in the trade. It'd probably be just the, you know, an hour's job or something like that. Yeah. To be to be honest, we don't really charge it's it's so hard for us to charge by the hours. We're literally charged by the job. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. Well, whatever. You know, that's that's fine. Yeah. Fine to do that. But, it's it's it's the thing that we'll probably need a formal quote from you. That's fair enough. And I'll get me some to we'll call back on this number a little while or or send the, send the video. Yeah? Alright. Well, I can see. Well, it's gonna say, basically, a new fence and gate at the back. So it's it's not it's not the kindest you're probably not the biggest job for somebody like yourself. And do you know Y Street? You must do just off London Road. I'm I'm to be honest, I'm more familiar with the Nottingham side, but, I've been I've been obviously going to Derby quite a lot, but not Yeah. No. It's not. Sat nav a lot these days, so I don't even take notice of the roads, to be honest. Yeah. No. Fair enough. No. I just wonder if you did because you get it might give you an idea. Alright. Leave that with me. I'll get them to give you a callback. Alright then. Well, do you use WhatsApp by any chance? Yeah. I do. Yeah. Yeah. Alright then. What I can do now, I'll send you a message over, and then you can either get your son to send it back or you can forward the number over or whatever. But I'll send you a message so we can keep contact. And then, yeah, okay. Well, this is my wife's phone, actually, because my my phone just literally is on charge. He died. But that's fine. Use this number anyway. Because I say I'm I'm going I'm I'm shooting off to London shortly. So, and then we'll get the get might wait till the morning, actually, to send you the video of the fencing, because, obviously, because it just because the, it's getting dark now. It's getting dark. So yeah. Sorry. Just to remind me, what was the jobs in the bathroom? Just It's just basically I think the toilet seat needs fixing. And I think there's a problem with the shower holder. So it may need a Okay. The actual yes. So it may need a a new holder. I don't know. Alright then. So I'll get that videoed as well if you like. Yeah. Well, that's the main thing, to be honest, because we don't give prices out blind because we just, obviously No. Fair enough. Like, do close-up that you know exactly what you're getting, and we know exactly what you're getting. I mean, obviously I'm just gonna self proceed, but the urgency is the bathroom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because we still live there on his own, and he's not too well at the minute. So that's why I've just shot someone. That's why I just wanna get someone in to do it. Someone who's local and who's reliable. But, alright. Leave that on me. May I take your name for reference? Sorry. My name's Courtney. What's yours? Garford. Garford. Garford. Garford. Yeah. Yeah.

    "transcript": "Yeah. Exactly. What is your number? It's the handyman number. That's what call well, that's what comes through to you. Oh, I have to obviously divert it, but I just didn't know if I didn't know if it's working or not. I'll definitely divert it because I don't know if it's state of sorts I do want. You are. No. No. No. No. It's diverting it's been diverting since. It's been killing me. Is that bad? It's way too hot. Wow. So to say it's 90 degrees, it's definitely hot, mate. It's like mid twenties at least. It's probably hot. Yeah. But sometimes it's hotter. It feels hotter than what it actually is, isn't it? Oh, this is definitely hotter than nine degrees or million percent. So what's it saying, Tom? Y'all can absorb. Oh, I'm gonna burn like a fucking crack saw, mate. I'm not paying a load. You get a lot of. Quite brown. Alexi is like a milk bottle, so she's definitely gonna burn it. And the only sunshine she decides to bring is fucking oil with 30 factor in it. So we're definitely gonna burn it. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. So food and knife, it's all inclusive. I'll be fucking it can't run it. Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah. You can eat whenever you want for I just don't feel like eating right now, to be honest. Oh, dear. I know what did that. They got fucking weed cuffs out here, aren't they? So I bought a gram the other guy. What? Weed cuffs. So I bought a gram the other night and fucking smoked half a zoo last night at the end of the night, and I know it absolutely fucked me up. Fucking hell. I remember sitting outside of McDonald's smoking it. Right. If you don't smoke, what's going on there? Can wipe you out. Oh, especially especially after all that drinking blooms as well. Oh, yeah. You're gonna fucking wipe death. I've I've I didn't wipe death. I handled it, but I was a mess. Did not wanna wake up this morning. Oh, fuck. Not drinking again either. I love a few beers. If if you fucking fill that out. Yeah. We're in it. We did say we was gonna have one night out on Tuesday night, and then we can then join the rest of the week. No. We didn't know. Alright. That's it now. To be fair, though, we got some banging steak the other night, you know, €31 for two sirloin steaks, chips, and a bottle of wine. That's not bad, really, is it? And when I say the steaks were banging, they're a good 8.5 out of 10. Okay. Now doing I'm starving talking about steaks. That's alright. If it's a little bit, though. 15 credit 6 or €15. How many euros do you get so far now? Oh, it's a bit shit. You know? So I changed €500. I know what 500, £500, I got €540. We gotta change very shit at the minute. Fucking hell. But in the summer, when I went Greece, I changed 3,000, and I got 3,500 or something. Okay. Now what? You took 3 and a half grand with me to Greece? Yeah. To Greece. Yeah. Okay. Now what's that much for? Because it's self catering over there. Oh, is it? Yeah. There's only one there's only one all inclusive on the resort, but it's shit. So, look, it's all say it's all self catering. But, obviously, I had Esme, Broads, and Alexia, and I got engaged out there. So that cost me money as well. Yeah. I took three and a half hours and spent every fucking penny, mate. Okay. Now looking you could even go through money, actually. No. Not over there even. You can go Greece on a budget, but I won't go on a budget. I was just going to spend what I was spending. But the holiday was cheap. Yes. It kinda levels up in midday. Yeah. No. Obviously, I have two kids and two adults. All inclusive is about 3, 3 and a half grand, I would say. Right. If you went Turkey or somewhere, it'd be about 3 and a half, maybe $4. Obviously, it's all inclusive, but you still need to take money. So really in Chile, it'll just took about five bags. But, obviously, I took the 3 and a half grand. The holiday was only, like, £1,200 for all of us. So it works out the same. Yeah. It's about the same. Oh, you know, I bring in that fucking woman that you had the on this what is it? She sent a video on the on the side of the stairs of the stairs. Yeah. Oh, she's fucking bugging. She had me talking on the phone for fucking ages. Oh, piss off. In the end, I just said, no. We can't do it. It's fucking annoying. No. Honestly, it was fucking negative evidence. Did that woman pay you with the blinds? Yeah. Finally. Oh, that's alright then. I took the issue paid. I took the. She's like, oh, my Internet bank is not working. I won't go to the bank tomorrow and all this and that thinking. Here we go. Yeah. Bullshit. What's that? Fucking shit. Coke. No alcohol in here, is that? Thank god for that. Fuck it. Just have a little drink. Oh, listen. You pour your own pints here, mate. Do you? Yeah. He goes to the bar, went to the bar, live in a house. I call off two beers. He's like, you're pouring yourself, mate. That's not how it sounds. Okay. Now I've had the money back in alcohol already. Wow. I'll be t y'all, I'll be fucking eating half an hour. Don't get me wrong. The food's very standard. Like, it's not anything amazing, but, obviously, you can eat what you want, when you want. Yeah. It's edible, but it's not amazing. Burgers and shit. Yeah. Burgers, hot dogs. Like, last night, it was chicken and paella and that. Like, for free, you can't move. Only one second. I don't know what this thing will be charging me. I forgot. It's under there. Alright. Alright. Alright. Sounds good. Yeah. That's it.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Good morning. Oh, hello. Is that HomeStreet's handyman? Yeah. How can I help? Oh, my name is miss miss Austin, and I was just wondering if you, put up roller blinds. Yes. We do. We definitely put roller blinds up. Have you got quite a few that you need putting on? I've got two, small ones that need to be put up, inside the same bathroom window recess. Okay. No problem. Have you already got the blinds made to measure? I've, I've sent away for the blinds. They will arrive, at the end of the week. I will be in need of your services on Monday morning. On Monday morning. Let me just double check if we got that. Yeah. We possibly could fit you Monday morning. We might have to get someone off another job, but we would be able to do it at a squeeze. Can I just take your postcode and see if it's I'll probably get a better idea? It's DE22 Yep. 2TForTommyJForJames. Perfect. Yeah. What I'd say, definitely we can definitely do that. Do you use WhatsApp by any chance? Yes. Just to make sure, obviously, the the type of windows that you've got with with this safe fit in a minute, it's all gonna go perfect. And, you know, so obviously, we could just send it to them. That, they are two, 50 centimeter wide blinds Yeah. In the recess, and there will be a gap down the middle. Okay. So you just want a small gap down the middle, but it's two blinds fitted on the one window. So so yes. Two blinds, that will drop down as it were in front of the two panes of of glass, with the hand pulleys by the side of the, by the tiles, by the wall. And it will leave, a gap down the middle. It is not going to be a one blind that's made to make this that goes straight across. They're two separate two separate blinds, So it will be a case of of, drilling into the, tiles, in the ceiling part of the recess. Okay. No problem. So is it is it tiles in the recess to you now? Or is it It's all tiled because it's the bathroom. Okay. No problem. Yeah. That's fine. What I can do how much would that be, please? Let me just have a look now just to make sure because just include with a tile bit, what it is, you just need, a tile drill bit. It basically cuts through tiles. You can't use any sort of tile drill bit. No. No. No. That's why I'm that's why I'm mentioning it. It is tiled. Yep. Perfect. Well, what what price we've got here? So it's a £118.89. That is, if you wanna book in for Monday. We do do a cheaper option of £95, but that is basically, we would let you know some point today what day we could fit you in. So it's basically on our route when we've got a job in your area. If you did wanna go for the Monday, I can get that all booked in now for a £118.89. You don't have to actually pay us the full amount now. We just take a deposit, but we have actually got that slot available for Monday. Okay. Right. Right. I'll that's rather a lot, isn't it? Just to put up two small roll lines. It's it's it's not at all really. When you take into consideration, we turn up on time. We guarantee the time slot. All of the guys that come in are vetted. We've got over 300, plus reviews on, Google. And the quality of work, to be honest, obviously covers what we do. We've got insurance. We make sure we turn up and get the job done right. And it's it's done all in one job. As you can appreciate, a lot of handymen, you'll probably find they actually turn up. They don't actually do the job properly. So our prices kinda showcase that sort of price. But we do obviously, like I said, you can get the cheaper rate, which is obviously when we're not gonna do I'll, I'll think about I'll think about it, and, just give me a minute or two to think about it, and then, and give you and can give you a callback. Okay. Yeah. No problem. Yeah. That's what I'll do. I'll send you a message. Just say if you change your mind, obviously, we still got this slot available. I'll send you a message now, and then, if you do wanna get in touch with the customer. Want you to send me a message, please. No. Alright. No. I won't send you a message. No. Don't send me a message, please. Alright. Okay. Alright. Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye bye. Bye.",

Yes. How are you? Yeah. Good, Denise. Yeah. Sorry. He was on the list to call today. Yeah. Basically, I did have a word. My dad didn't send him over the, videos and stuff of the on the side of the stairs. Yeah. We did have a brief chat, and to be honest, he he said it's not something where he's tackled before. Yeah. So he wouldn't be sort of comfortable with cladding it because he wouldn't wanna use yours as, like, a test, if you get what I mean. It's not something that you sun. Yeah. Really comfortable with. In terms of getting your quote back for the skirting upstairs, that's not a problem. Yeah. The carpet, I'm just waiting on that to come back because we don't actually do the carpet fitting. There's a guy we work with you, comes on all the jobs. Yeah. If you have any carpet fitting, you you can do that side of it. Yeah. In terms up to now, you can get your quote sent over to obviously do the skirting replacement upstairs. Yep. The laminate flooring replacement upstairs as long as you've got enough laminate. Yeah. Did you have the underlay with the laminate as well? No. It's not. I've got to cap. Okay. No problem. Oh, yeah. These fill basically, the laminate for the flooring area upstairs as well as the, skirting. Yep. And then, the carpet, obviously, we were waiting on. That's not gonna be today. I don't think I can try for tomorrow. Yeah. And then just on the side of the stairs, obviously, that up to now is gonna be we'd possibly leave that because we just wouldn't we can possibly if you did go ahead with the other stuff, we could possibly have a look when when we're there in person. It's just we don't we wouldn't feel comfortable fitting something that we've not, of course, sort of done before if you get what I mean. Yeah. I totally understand. The thing is because I needed the first thing I need to do was actually the staircase. I have got a guy coming out tomorrow. He's gonna have a look at it. Yeah. But like I say, still send me the quote over regarding the rest of the work. Yeah. You know, when you say the staircase, do you mean, the underside of the staircase or the ballast balusters and stuff that was loaded up there? All of it doing. All of it doing. The rest one that I see and when I spoke to you regarding the glass, I'm just gonna send you a picture while I'm talking to you. Yeah. When I was talking to you regarding the glass, and was it you that was saying that the glass is very expensive? If you're getting me to measure, yeah. I know we've looked it before, and it was, like Yeah. But it's a picture what prices you've seen. Yeah. There was a picture I've seen, if I can find it now, yesterday. I really did like the look. There. I'm just gonna send it to you. Yeah. Send it here. While I'm talking to you. Yeah. But like I say, I don't wanna be paying a ridiculous amount if it is gonna be some really expensive, the glass. Yeah. To be honest, we we I think it was only one job that someone wanted pricing back for. I think even when we got the customer, we was quite shocked, what the company wanted, obviously, to come out, measure up. Uh-huh. Yeah. That does look really nice, to be honest. See, it's what I'm thinking. I've already got the wood. So probably our our other guy the guy that was gonna do it was gonna take the wooden post at at the bottom, and he was gonna replace it with a chrome rod To keep the price down, I could probably keep the wooden one, strip it back so it can be painted, like, get all the other paint off it, and then fabric so really, basically, it's just moving the wooden panels that I've already got and replacing it with something like that. It sounds simple. But to be honest, if if to get this job done, for one, it's a professional joiner's job. Like, it's not handyman's job. That is a professional joiner because the way it needs to be adapted, you're working with glass. There's no room for error when you're doing something like this. It's not just a odd job manual. Obviously, majority of us that work for us are, like, my dad's a skilled joiner, but even alone, he wouldn't tackle a project like that. Normally, you've got, like, a specialist joiner or a specialist company that does that sort of work, if I'm honest with you. Yeah. And it is quite expensive. I don't know if you've looked at the price of what that sort of, design cost, but I'm guessing it's easily over $121,300 quid. Wow. That's fair enough. That one. Yeah. It's it's not cheap. I can now have a look myself, and I can have a quick Google about the phone and signal. But I know it's not it's not cheap, and the right sort of person does need to do it. Right. Gotcha. But in terms of the skirting Yeah. The carpet fitting, obviously, I can't get that straight away. So I'm just skirting laminate. That that shouldn't be a problem. Yep. But, yeah, something like that. I'd be honest with you. I just I'd go to someone that does it day in, day out because it's it's a specialist sort of job. Yeah. But thank you for that. No. No. No. Just obviously, it wouldn't we we kinda do what we're good at, and we don't like to step out of that. You know what I mean? Because Yeah. I I totally understand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Because we are really busy, and we we actually charge to plan a quote because we've we've no way we'd get out otherwise. If you can just do us a quick video and show us the room.

Four four lots are just they wanna see my paperwork, which is all up to date to my file. So it's about fifteen, sixteen jobs, changing doors, worktops, units Yeah. Dampen dampen mold, circuit board, change your door, fire alarms. I don't know. I never heard of this one before. All my fire alarms are battery operated. But this guy, not the city council, is saying no. He wants them interlinking. Yeah. They have to be interlinked now, mate. They can't be battery operated anymore. Oh, so they're changing it all then? Yeah. Basically, yeah. They're coming to pay now. Basically, so basically, what we do, we just we just pull a wire from the lamp lamp shade, don't we? Lamp socket. No. They don't even have to be done like that, to be fair. You can get one you can get one now with they're basically still battery operated. However, they all link to what to want. So, like, a main one that you'd put in, like, the kitchen, for example. And then you'll get, like, a little remote with it. And when you press test, it will set them all off at the same time to make sure that they're all linked. Are they are they quite expensive? It's not really, mate. They're not they're not too expensive, to be fair. Right. Right. When okay. Kind of I I reckon, Richard, from my experience, after I've been seeing this account showed him on my paper, got about fifteen, sixteen jobs. I mean, how would you charge? Would you charge an hourly rate, or would it be a full day full day rate? It would go down on the work to be fair. We'd work that out after we look at all the work that needs to be done because it might mean I have to get different tradesmen in, for example. I might need a joiner, and then I might need electrician. Do you know what I mean? So it'd be all just one price, basically. I'd give you a price for everything, and then I'll come in and get all the jobs done. Alright. With me. I'll be in touch very soon. Alright. No worries. Appointment with this guy on Monday.

Not a problem. The easiest way for us to do it, to use WhatsApp. Yeah. What I'll do, I'll send you a message off our business WhatsApp. Mhmm. If if you could just send us, like, a video of your stairway Yeah. And then or any any of the skirting boards that you need replacing. And then that way, we can go back and forth and with some ideas. Yeah. Also, I need paint on the upstairs carpet. So I've had to lift the landing carpet up. So I need, floor doing upstairs. Got some laminate because I've not long had my kitchen done, and I've got some laminate left over. And I was thinking if you could use that and then carpet the stairs. So just laminate the top of the landing and then up at the stairs just going down. Yeah. We can definitely do that. Can I just state your name, please? Yeah. It's Denise. And can I state your postcode, please, Denise? Yeah. It's NG3 Yep. 4JQ. 4JQ. No. How do you charge? Do you charge by the hour or do you charge by what the job is? Depends what kind of job it is. Mhmm. Yeah. We'll need to look into it, then we'll figure out the best and cheapest option for you as such. Yeah. Yeah. So best best thing to do is try and get some videos over, and then we can take a proper look into it and go from there. You want me to text wait. You want me to text videos off? Do I need to do a video or just a few pictures? You can do pictures. A video of the staircase would be better because it'll give us a better look into it. Oh. Yeah. But, like, the skirting boards and that, just a picture of how much of, like, where the skirting board is as such and how much Yeah. You see, I do want quite a bit of work doing, but, obviously, not all in the one, Gary, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's fine. The door space in upstairs as well. In quote for individual jobs anyway as such. Yeah. And what's the, time scale if you want to go ahead? And if you're in whenever, to be honest, we've got quite a few in demand, so we can get you get you in at any point as such. Yeah. So what I'll do is then, obviously, send it to WhatsApp video of the staircase and the, the strutting board. I want replacing upstairs. Yeah. Yeah. And then we'll, get we'll take a look into it. Yeah. And, obviously, I will need a laminate flooring at the top of the landing, which I've got. I don't know if I've got enough. I might have to buy another pack, and then, obviously, carpet. You do do you can you supply the car, Pip? We can do. Yeah. It shouldn't be a problem. Yeah. Yeah. Okay then. And what's your name? Sorry. Richard. Richard. Richard. So you're gonna send me the you know, just so I can message now. Yeah. Yeah. And then I can do it. Okay. I'll do it later because I've got to pop out. But thank you, Richard. No worries. No problem. Thank you very much. K. Thanks a lot, and I'll be in touch. Bye. Yeah. Bye bye.",

I just can't send you quickly because I just sent the pictures before I go out. Yeah. You know regarding the staircase? Yeah. So you know where the box the back of the staircase is? It was gonna put paneling white paneling on that all the way down to the skirting board. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. That one. Yeah. That's a little bit. Yeah. That's gonna be good. And, also, the, skirting board that once replaced in is the gray one, and I want the same as what I've got in the kitchen. You know the white? Look at look while I'm on the phone. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's fine. We can do that. And like I say, if you think it's best not to take the wood off, just to paint it or whatever, the only thing is it's had quite a few coats of paint, and I actually use water base. Right. And it it's peeling, which Got you. Yeah. Obviously, it it don't stay on. Also, the handrail on the other side, that needs replacing as well. Right. Could you just take a picture of that, please, if if possible? Send it in the video. Send it in the video. That would be great. I think I have done. I think it is on. I'm just having a look at the video. I've just sent yeah. I'm sure I did send it. I'm just having a look. Yeah. It it's going up the stairs, look, the handrail Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I can see it. You see where I've where where the carpet is, where I've painted again, that was again, I used water based. And as I've ripped the tape up and the masking tape, it it took the paint off it. So that needs to be done as well. So it's only the handrail on the wall that you want replacing, not on the stairs itself as well? No. That's what I'm saying. I'm open to my gear. What the guy was gonna do the guy that did the kitchen for me, what he was gonna do was he was gonna take those replace the handrail to a a chrome one. Yeah. And then on the other side where the wood is, he was gonna take that off, and he was gonna replace it with glass. I mean, that is that is a possibility. Yeah. The glass isn't cheap, though. I don't know what he would Yeah. That's what I'm saying. If you can think of other ideas that you think might be better. Yep. Right. Let me, I'm just gonna call one of my handymen and have a word with him, my joiner, that deals with all that kind of side of things, and I'll get his input on it, then that'll be the best option. Then I'll come back to you with it. Yeah. I'm popping out now because I'm going to a 03:00. No. That's fine. I will be back.

I was wondering if you'd come out and have a look at the mall and give me a price for doing it. Yeah. I can do, mate. What is it that you require? Okay. It's a list of the council. So they've given me quite a big list. The stuff like going down into the basement, they'd like a handrail. In the basement, they'd like the underside of the basement, boarding with fireboard and skimming. Internally, there's some old wooden doors where the glass is not safety glass, so they want that replacing. Install the handrail to the external steps. There's loads of stuff. Create concrete step in the garden. Doors, which I've to sort of got a UPVC car doing the doors. Just like crappy little jobs. Is there any way I could say it? There's two ways of doing it, mate. You can either send us a list over WhatsApp. We can quote that way or can come out and see it. There's a 39 plan charge for us to come out and quote it up. However, if you do go ahead with the work, it will come off the end of the bill. So I'll just send you the letter that the council will give me instead because I'm I'm not typing out WhatsApp. I'll just send the message to you. I'll do it. I'll send you an email from the if you got you got an email address from you? I'll you'd be able to send it through WhatsApp? I can do, but I won't be able to talk and liaise via WhatsApp afterwards. I don't I don't Right. I can only talk on the phone or use an actual computer. Right. WhatsApp. Let me see. Private messaging. Yeah. I can download this and send it. But, yeah, I'm I'm I can I can send it off my computer by using it, but I'm not I'm not regularly on? I'm not one of these people that checks the WhatsApps all the time. Yeah. No. That's not a problem. One moment. I'll do it now. You'll have it. I'll send you the letter. And then, you know, it's not everything that's on there, but it's most of the stuff that's on there. Alright. No worries. What I'll do is I'll send you a message on WhatsApp. Now if you just ping it over, then I'll give you a callback. We'll just run a phone. No. That's fine. I've managed to get this. It's fine. I'm gonna hold on. I'm gonna do this account. Can I ask how how busy you are as well? Because I need it doing by December 16. Yeah.

So I measured it. The, width is about three foot by three foot, and the length, like, in height is about eight foot. Now it's quite an old storage room, obviously, these old style houses like, out of the three floors. And it should've got, like, all this old wallpapering and stuff on it, which I will need to strip down and then just, like, basically, just to give it a lick of paint because I'm due to have a baby literally in two weeks. It's not the ideal time, but it's only just been cleared up now. Problem is I don't wanna put the baby stuff in there, you know, like dust and all that stuff that's probably been behind the walls gathered up for the past fifteen years. It just gives me anxiety. So I just wanted to know if it's, like, a possible job. Yeah. We can we can get you a quote for it. Yeah. That's definitely doable. Could I just take your name, please? Yeah. My name is Shazia, s h a z I a. No worries. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you a message off our business WhatsApp. Choose WhatsApp. Yep. If you could just take us a a picture of the storage room, and then we'll get you quoted straight up. Yeah. I've taken a short video. Yeah. That's brilliant. Yeah. Send the video. Because, but like I said, I do need it done ASAP. I know he thinks he's gonna be a handyman and all that, but we ain't got time. Oh, no. No. I'm not doing a DIY job because, like I said, the baby could be coming any day now and just, obviously I'm trying to get as organized as possible. I just need it done ASAP. So it will just obviously mean stripping down the walls of whatever wallpaper has been stuck for, like, ten, fifteen years and just giving it a lick of paint, then at least I feel a little bit better when I do stack or storage, whatever I do in there. But that's fine. We can get that done for you. That's not a problem. Yeah. I'm gonna send you that message now then. If you just send the video, get your phone. Great. I'll forward that to you now.
