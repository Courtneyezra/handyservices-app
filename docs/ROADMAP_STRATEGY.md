# Switchboard Maturity Roadmap: From Tool to Teammate

## Executive Summary
We are pivoting focus from "Future Agentic Autonomy" to **"Immediate Operational Utility"**. The goal is to make the platform robust for the *current* low-volume, high-touch workflow, while keeping the AI architecture ready for the future.

---

## Phase 1: The "Bionic" CRM (Immediate Focus)
**Goal**: "Use the platform NOW."
**Philosophy**: The Human is the Pilot. The Software is the controls.
**Key Requirements**:
1.  **Stability**: No crashes, no missing outcome data (Fixed).
2.  **Efficiency**: "One-Click" actions for the human (Quote, Invoice, Schedule).
3.  **Data Integrity**: Reliable storage of Calls, Leads, and Customer details.
4.  **Mobile/Field Utility**: Contractors can easily receive jobs and upload photos.

*Priorities for Discussion:*
- [ ] **Invoicing & Payments**: Can you get paid easily?
- [ ] **Calendar/Scheduling**: Is the dispatch flow smooth?
- [ ] **Contractor App**: Is the "Accept Job" flow frictionless?

## Phase 2: The "Co-Pilot" (The "Assisted" Layer) / *We are here technically* /
**Goal**: "Reduce Human Cognitive Load."
**Philosophy**: The AI *drafts*, the Human *approves*.
**Features (Already MVP'd)**:
- [x] **Smart Context**: "As discussed regarding your shower..." (Drafts).
- [x] **One-Click Actions**: converting a transcript to a "Draft Actions" card.
- [ ] **Outbound Nudges**: Reminding the human to follow up on quotes.

---

## Phase 3: The "Agentic" Workflow (Future / High Volume)
**Goal**: "Handle the Overflow."
**Philosophy**: The AI *acts*, the Human *reviews exceptions*.
**Trigger**: When volume > Human Capacity.
**Features**:
- Autonomous scheduling negotiation.
- Auto-chasing unpaid invoices.
- "Voice Mode" answering calls directly.

---

## Recommendation
We should freeze **Phase 2 & 3** development (Code is essentially done/MVP) and double down on **Phase 1**.

**Question**: What is the single biggest friction point preventing you from running your *entire* business on this platform today?
1.  Is it quoting speed?
2.  Is it scheduling/calendar visibility?
3.  Is it contractor management?
4.  Is it simple bugs/UI glitches?
