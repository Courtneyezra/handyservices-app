# Glossary

## System Terms

| Term | Definition | Context/File |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Switchboard** | The central dashboard and logic engine that manages incoming calls, visualizes live data, and routes connections. | `[server/twilio-realtime.ts](/server/twilio-realtime.ts)` |
| **SKU** | **Stock Keeping Unit**. In this system, it refers to a "Productized Service" (e.g., "Boiler Service", "Tap Replacement"). The system attempts to map vague voice intents to concrete SKUs. | `[server/skuDetector.ts](/server/skuDetector.ts)` |
| **Live Call** | A call currently in progress where the system is actively transcribing audio and listening for intents. | `[client/src/contexts/LiveCallContext.tsx]` (Inferred) |
| **Agent Mode** | A setting determining how calls are routed. Modes include `auto` (Business logic), `manual-va` (Force human), `manual-ai` (Force AI), or `voicemail`. | `[server/call-routing-engine.ts](/server/call-routing-engine.ts)` |
| **Meta Cloud API** | The API provided by Meta (Facebook) to interact with WhatsApp programmatically, bypassing traditional BSPs like Twilio for messaging. | `[server/meta-whatsapp.ts](/server/meta-whatsapp.ts)` |
| **Visual Quote** | A quote type recommendation where the complexity of the job requires the customer to provide a video or photo walkthrough before a price is given. | `[server/quote-engine.ts](/server/quote-engine.ts)` |
| **Job Scope** | A classifier for jobs (Single vs. Multiple) used to calculate quote complexity. | `[server/quote-engine.ts](/server/quote-engine.ts)` |
| **Contractor Profile** | A record linked to a system user that contains handyman-specific data like skills, coverage radius, and availability. | `shared/schema.ts` |

## External Concepts

| Term | Definition | Context |
|------|------------|---------|
| **TwiML** | **Twilio Markup Language**. XML instructions sent to Twilio to tell it how to handle a call (Say, Play, Record, Stream, Dial). | `[server/index.ts](/server/index.ts)` |
| **CallSid** | Unique identifier for a phone call generated by Twilio. Used as the primary key for tracking active calls. | `[server/call-logger.ts](/server/call-logger.ts)` |
| **StreamSid** | Unique identifier for the specific WebSocket media stream within a call. | `[server/twilio-realtime.ts](/server/twilio-realtime.ts)` |
| **Nova-2** | The specific deep learning model used by Deepgram for speech-to-text. Known for speed and accuracy. | `[server/twilio-realtime.ts](/server/twilio-realtime.ts)` |

## Business Entities

| Term | Definition | Context |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Lead** | A potential customer identified from a call. Created when a call intent is successfully captured. | `shared/schema.ts` |
| **VA** | **Virtual Assistant**. A human operator designated to answer calls during business hours. | `[server/call-routing-engine.ts](/server/call-routing-engine.ts)` |
| **Eleven** | Shorthand for "Eleven Labs Agent", the AI voice bot that handles calls when the VA is unavailable. | `[server/eleven-labs/]` |

## Verification

The following assumptions were made:

1.  **Assumption**: `shared/schema.ts` defines the `Lead` and `Sku` entities.
    *   *Verify via*: Codebase search for `shared/schema.ts`.
