## Pricing Model Options

### Model A: Pure SaaS (Landlord Pays All)

```
Landlord pays: £15-30/property/month
Includes: Portal, AI chat, tenant app, checklist, rewards fund

Tenant pays: Nothing
Gets: App, rewards (£5-10/month from landlord's fee)

Platform keeps: Full subscription
```

**Pros:**
- Simple pricing
- Predictable revenue
- Landlord sees clear ROI

**Cons:**
- Higher barrier to entry
- Landlord may resist funding tenant rewards
- Competes with "free" alternatives

---

### Model B: Freemium + Job Commission

```
Landlord pays: FREE basic tier
             £10/property for premium features
             15-20% commission on jobs we complete

Tenant pays: Nothing
Gets: App, rewards funded by job margin

Platform keeps: Commission + premium subs
```

**Pros:**
- Low barrier to entry
- Aligned incentives (we want fewer jobs too... or do we?)
- Easy to try

**Cons:**
- Conflict: We profit from jobs, but program reduces jobs
- Revenue unpredictable
- May feel "free but not really"

---

### Model C: Value-Based (Shared Savings)

```
Landlord pays: Baseline £10/property/month
             + Contributes 50% of proven savings to reward fund

Example: Saved £200/year → £100 goes to tenant rewards
         Landlord still nets £100 savings
         Platform gets £120/year subscription

Tenant pays: Nothing
Gets: Meaningful rewards tied to actual savings

Platform keeps: Subscription + installation margin
```

**Pros:**
- Everyone wins proportionally
- Landlord only pays more if saving more
- Tenant rewards feel earned

**Cons:**
- Complex to calculate/prove savings
- Requires baseline measurement
- Harder to explain

---

### Model D: Tiered Service Levels

```
TIER 1 - BASIC (Free)
- Issue reporting only
- AI triage
- No tenant self-repair
- Full price on jobs

TIER 2 - SMART (£15/property/month)
- Tenant checklist
- DIY guides
- Photo verification
- £5/month tenant rewards (platform funded)
- 10% job discount

TIER 3 - PREMIUM (£30/property/month)
- Everything in Smart
- Easy-fix installations included
- £10/month tenant rewards
- Priority response
- 20% job discount
- Quarterly property health report
```

**Pros:**
- Clear upgrade path
- Captures different landlord types
- Premium feels premium

**Cons:**
- Complexity
- May cannibalize job revenue at higher tiers

---

### Model E: Per-Property-Per-Tenant

```
Landlord pays: £5/tenant/month (not per property)

1 property, 1 tenant = £5/month
1 property, 3 tenants (HMO) = £15/month
5 properties, 5 tenants = £25/month

Tenant rewards: £3/month from fee + £2 platform subsidy = £5 total

Platform keeps: £2/tenant margin + job revenue
```

**Pros:**
- Scales with actual usage
- Fair for small landlords
- HMO landlords pay proportionally

**Cons:**
- Lower revenue per property
- Tracking tenant count

---

## Recommended Strategy: "Landlord ROI Guarantee"

### The Pitch
> "Pay £20/property/month. If you don't save at least £240/year in maintenance costs, we refund the difference."

### Breakdown
| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Landlord pays | £20/month (£240/year) | Per property |
| Tenant reward fund | £8/month included | Platform tops up £2 |
| Platform revenue | £12/month retained | £144/year |
| Installation upsell | £200 one-time | Optional, £80 margin |

### Why This Works

**For Landlord:**
- Zero risk - guaranteed ROI or money back
- £240/year cost vs £400+ typical savings
- Tenant rewards = better tenant behaviour
- "Set and forget" - we handle everything

**For Tenant:**
- £10/month rewards (£120/year)
- App, guides, checklist
- Feels valued, not exploited
- Skills development

**For Platform:**
- £144/year base revenue per property
- Job revenue when DIY fails (est. 60% of issues still need pro)
- Installation margin (£80 per property)
- High retention (guarantee builds trust)
- Data moat (hard for competitors to match)

### Revenue Projection (100 Properties)

| Revenue Stream | Annual | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Subscriptions | £14,400 | 100 × £144 |
| Job commission (40% need pro) | £9,600 | 100 × 2 jobs × £120 margin |
| Installations (50% uptake) | £4,000 | 50 × £80 margin |
| **Total** | **£28,000** | Year 1 |

## Key Questions to Decide

### 1. Do we want fewer jobs or more jobs?
- **Fewer jobs** = subscription model, platform funds some rewards
- **More jobs** = freemium, commission-based, DIY just filters easy stuff

### 2. Who funds tenant rewards?
- **Landlord funds 100%** = Higher landlord cost, simpler
- **Platform funds 100%** = Lower landlord cost, compressed margin
- **Split** = Balanced, but complex messaging

### 3. Are installations a profit center or loss leader?
- **Profit center** = £200 install, £80 margin
- **Loss leader** = £100 install at cost, locks them into ecosystem

### 4. What's our positioning?
- **Cost saver** = "Reduce maintenance spend by 40%"
- **Peace of mind** = "Never worry about tenant issues again"
- **Tenant relationship** = "Happy tenants, happy investment"
- **Time saver** = "Get your weekends back"

### 5. Competitive moat?
- **Data** = We know which fixes work, predict issues
- **Network** = Best tenants want our landlords, best landlords want our tenants
- **Behaviour change** = Tenants trained to self-serve, won't go elsewhere

## Next Steps

1. **Pick a model** - Which resonates with your vision?
2. **Test pricing** - Ask 5 landlords "would you pay £X for Y?"
3. **Build MVP** - Start with simplest version
4. **Measure** - Track actual savings to prove ROI
5. **Iterate** - Adjust pricing based on real data
